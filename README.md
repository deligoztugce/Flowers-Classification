# Flowers-Classification

This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning for classifying five types of flowers (Daisy, Dandelion, Roses, Sunflowers, and Tulips) using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained model.

## Overview
The dataset is a collection of flower images from the TensorFlow flower dataset. The task is to classify each image into one of the five flower types. The model leverages MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, followed by a custom dense layer for classification.

## Requirements
You need the following Python packages to run the code:

- tensorflow
- tensorflow-hub
- opencv-python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

### Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub opencv-python pandas numpy matplotlib
